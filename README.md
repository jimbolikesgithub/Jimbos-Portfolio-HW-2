# Jimbos-Portfolio-HW-2

--- This project had us create a portfolio using nothing but our knowledge (and some help from
Google and Youtube). I honestly struggled a lot with this (especially the flexbox images in the 
Work section).  ---

index.html - 
----------
* Used the ! to create a new HTML and added some of my own images from projects I've done previously on CodePen.

* Threw in some helpful documentation for easier code readability.

style.css - 
---------
* Used CSS reset so I could add my own styling.

* Struggled for over a day with flexbox untill I found help on Stack Overflow.
